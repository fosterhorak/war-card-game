# IT'S WAR! THE CARD GAME
This is war (the card game). 

# Background Info
This is application let's you play war (the card game) online -- no card deck necessary. 

  #### Start of Game
A 52 card deck is shuffled and dealt evenly between two players.

  #### Duel
The players "duel" by flipping over the top card from their deck onto the "battle field".
The player with the higher value card "wins" the "duel" and get to the cards from the "battle field" to the bottom of their deck.
This is called "collecting the spoils" (in my game). 

  #### War
If the players flip over cards of the same value, then they go to "war".

During a "war" each player adds 3 cards (face down) from their deck to the "battle field", then flips over a 4th card.
The player with the higher value 4th card gets to add ALL the cards from the "battle field" to the bottom of their deck. 
If players flip over a card of the same value again, they will go to "war" again until someone wins.

  #### End of Game
The game ends when a player runs out of cards (or is unable to go to war).
This means if a player only has 3 cards and must go to war, they will lose the game because they need 4 cards to go to war.
This player will forfeit their cards to their opponent. 

The winner of the overall game is called the "victor". 
At the end of the game, the "victor" will hold all 52 cards.

  #### Card Values
Numbered cards have a value matching their number.
Face cards have a value of 10.
Aces have a value of 11.
